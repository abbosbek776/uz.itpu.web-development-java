Step 3. Identify the most important elements and content for the users. How will you place it on the page?

Step 6. Test your prototype and implement changes.

Step 7. Transfer your prototype to an HTML/JS version. It should be possible to open it in any web browser without errors or overlaps and to complete both basic and advanced scenarios.
